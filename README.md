# Applied Machine Learning for Performance Analysis

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze and classify human movement data. It focuses on three core tasks: **Human Activity Recognition**, **Fall Detection**, and **Fitness Activity Classification**.

## Features

- Preprocessing of time-series sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope)  
- Model training using classical ML algorithms (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, k-NN)  
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Visualization of activity predictions and performance metrics

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance-ml.git
   cd performance-ml
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the scripts in `src/` or explore the notebooks in `notebooks/` to train and test models.

## Datasets

Data can be imported from public sources like [UCI HAR](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) or custom wearable sensor data.

## Results

Model performance and confusion matrices are saved in the `results/` folder.

You can paste this directly into a Jupyter notebook markdown cell or a `README.md` file.
