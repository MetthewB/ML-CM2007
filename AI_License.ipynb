    "**Project: Responsible AI licensing in sports - Catapult Sports' PlayerTek system**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In sports technology, many software products, such as Catapult Sports' PlayerTek system, combine artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to easily track sports performance. This wearable GPS tracking system captures countless performance metrics like distance covered, race track, speed, or acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI part of the PlayerTek system processes the raw data to extract meaningful features that are different aspects of a player’s performance. These factors can include complex information such as changes in speed, rate of movement and energy expenditure. An ML model is then trained on this processed data, learning from the movements, coordination or physiology of the players. Raw data become insights for delivering personalized recommendations and training for athletes. \n",
